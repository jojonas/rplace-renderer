Renderer for the /r/place reddit 2017 April fools game
======================================================

The binary data has been recorded and made available by user /u/mncke [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/6396u5/rplace_archive_update/).

Download `diffs.bin` (187 MB) from the reddit thread and use this code to render.

The file `place_renderer.py` contains the (sample) code to simulate and render /r/place. 
Call it as follows: `python place_renderer.py diffs.bin` to generate a bunch of PNG-files.


Further ideas are welcome, post them as an issue!
